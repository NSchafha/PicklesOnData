            <h1>My First Internship Experience at Co-operators: Insurance and investments</h1>

            <p>
                During my internship, I worked as a BI Specialist applying my analytical and
                collaborative skills towards new initiatives and innovation.
            </p>


            <h2>Key Responsibilities</h2>

            <p>
                My key responsibilities included improving our Beyond Asset Management (BAM) Power App, which we used to
                track and manage our data and analytics assets. I worked on features that supported asset ownership,
                lineage, document storage, and our Asset Value Score (AVS) along with its scoring methods.
            </p>

            <h2>Major Projects</h2>

            <h3>1. BAM & BET</h3>

            <h3>2. Asset Value Scores Historization</h3>

            <h3>3. BAM LITE</h3>

            <h4>Overview</h4>

            <p>
                BAM LITE is a low-code power app designed for individual contributors and managers who need to quickly:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Access and lookup BAM assets and evaluations
                </li>

                <li>
                    Evaluate assets
                </li>

                <li>
                    Create new assets
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h4>
                Purpose & Design Philosophy
            </h4>

            <p>
                Analysis of Bam usage shows that the majority of usage align with the three core solutions outlined
                above.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The top 8 screens (out of 40) account for 91% of overall usage.
                </li>

                <li>
                    By condensing these into 4 streamlined screens, BAM LITE delivers the same functionality with
                    greater
                    efficiency.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The core principle is to keep the app LITE, prioritizing efficient queries, simplified navigation, and
                reduced clutter.
            </p>

            <h4>Benchmarks</h4>

            <p>Performance improvements were measured under controlled conditions:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Chrome browser only</li>
                <li>Single production-level BAM instance running at a time</li>
                <li>Results broken down by initial data load</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Improvements</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Efficient Data Handling:
                        BAM LITE retrieves read-only data via direct SharePoint access, avoiding local storage in the
                        application.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        Optimized Initialization:
                        Refactored BAM’s On-Start (loading) property, removing 97% of its logic and distributing
                        functionality across individual screens. This significantly reduced BAM’s initial loading time.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        Refactored score calculation logic:
                        The previous ‘reverse-pyramid’ approach applied filters across all data; the new design joins
                        only data relevant to the target asset, improving efficiency and accuracy
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>
                One of my main goals for this internship was to connect with and learn from a variety of people and
                teams. With my department havgin more than 200 people, I was able to connect with many different teams.
            </p>

            <p>
                Similar to my experience at LAO, having the opportunioty to research and develop my own project is
                something I am really grateful for, and is something I love doing. From desgin to development I applied
                my previous experiences through the SDLC steps, and set clear goals for both the project and myself.
            </p>

            <p>
                This internship, while starting off at a slower pace, became one of the best professional experiences of
                my career. The flexibility and support received across the board allowed me to comeplete many
                significant miletones and work across a diverse group of projects. I truly enjoyed my time here and look
                forward to applying what I've learned in my future endeavors.
